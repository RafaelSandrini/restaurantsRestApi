# restaurantsRestApi

In this repository I deployed a REST API into Heroku.

I'm using the MongoDB to store the database.

You can check bellow the links for the application and some instructions to use.

https://restapimoodme.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants/cuisine/American?size=3&page=2
(You can change the word "American" for another kind of cuisine)
(you can replace the number of "size" to show more or less results on each page, and on the "page" number, you choose which page of results you want to see)

 

https://restapimoodme.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants/name/Riviera?size=3&page=1
(You can change the word "Riviera" for another name of restaurant)

 

https://restapimoodme.herokuapp.com/api/restaurants?size=10&page=1
(Here you see all restaurants)
